# Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) waiting times

This folder contains raw data from two sources, as EIP waiting times were reported separately prior to and following September 2019.

This data was initially reported separately from the Mental Health Services Dataset (MHSDS) as providers were not flowing the full dataset during this period.

The data captures waiting times in weekly bands from referral to treatment.

Some providers who submitted data indicated that there may be data quality issues with their submissions. 

Two main issues were raised: 
1. Some providers were not able to include referrals made prior to 1st December 2015 due to the way that they had previously captured data. 
2. Some providers were only able to include waiting times for referrals made to their dedicated EIP teams. These teams may only provide a services to a limited age range; often people aged 35 and under. 

Both of these issues mean the numbers of patients who started treatment and incomplete pathways are likely to be under reported. This may also result in the percentage achievement against the standard being artificially inflated.
